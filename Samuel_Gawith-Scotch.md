# Review of *Samuel Gawith*, *Scotch* snuff #
[Wamuel Gawith 10g Tap-Box Scotch](http://i.imgur.com/w6naC6D.jpg)

This is the second snuff I am reviewing, from my snuff.me.uk order. 

## Grind / Color / Moisture

[The snuff](http://i.imgur.com/qiuhvDT.jpg)

It is a very coarse dry snuff, like desert sand, or small
gravel. Black color. If you sake the tap box it rattles.

Much coarser than the *Wilsons Of Sharrow* snuffs that I am used to.

The dryness could be because of the tap-box. I don't know if they are
supposed to come wrapped in plastic or not but this one was not. 


## Tin aroma

Smelling from the hole in the tap-box you get just a strong tobacco
smell, like smelling a box of regular cigarettes.

## Flavor

The flavor reminds me of a farm or stable. Besides the tobacco smell
there is a smell of hay and dirt. Again, this could be because it is
stale from the poor tap-box. Besides the dryness of the snuff the
smell was not pleasant to me at all. 


## Nicotine hit

I really couldn't tell, maybe if I could keep it in my nose longer it
would have helped.



## Difficulty

This was very difficult to take, not because it was to fine but just
the opposite. It was so dry and coarse that I couldn't get the
granules to stick in my nostril, they just kept falling out. I finaly
sniffed so hard that I got it lodged in my sinuses, I still think I
have some stuck in there from 24 hours ago. It has been slowly comming
out and there are huge peices, about 1/2 the size of my pinky nail. 


## Summary 

Like I mentioned before, this could have been because of the tap-box,
or the poor packaging from snuff.me.uk, but this snuff was just an
awful experience for me, and I really tried to like it. I gave it a
few days of use and I just can't take it.

I also don't think I could even sell it.

If anyone is interestsed, send me a few BC to cover postage and I'll
send it to you.
