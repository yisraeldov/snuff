This is my fist snuff review so I look forward to hearing your feedback.

I just got my first order from [Snuff.me](http://snuff.me.uk), and I plan to review everything little by little.

*Tiger Snuff - Cola* is an *energy snuff*, or tobbaco free snuff. Something I wanted to order because my kids always want to try to smell my snuff, and I don't feel that comfortable letting them play around with tobbaco products. 

## Grind / Color / Moisture

The snuff is a fluffy white powder, seems to be pretty moist. This being my first tobacco free snuff, I don't know what to compare it to. 

It can leave a bit of white powder on your nose so be sure to clean yourself if you use it in public.

## Tin aroma

One of the reasons I ordered this snuff is that I love cola but can't take the sugar. One of my favorite candies as a kid was gummy cola bottles, this snuff smells almost exactly like that.

It's hard to get a real *tin aroma* because of the *tap box* ( this is also my first time with a tap box ), but you get a real sweet cola candy smell.

## Flavor

There isn't much difference from the *tin aroma*, sweet cola candy. You can detect a little spice to it, something like ginger and cinnamon, but I think this is really just one of the aspects of the cola smell. This is not a medicated snuff.

The smell stays with you for a while, actually longer than proper snuffs that I have tried. It really can help with cola cravings, and I'm curious if it will have the same anti-nausea properties of real cola. 

## Nicotine hit

Obviously there is no nicotine, but it was advertised as an *energy snuff*, according to [Mr Snuff](https://mrsnuff.com/tiger-cola-p-874.html) this has Guarana in it, and should help boost energy and concentration. Because of that I avoided taking it last night when I first received it, scarred that it would mess with my sleep. 

I took a rather big portion this morning before my coffee, after about 10 minuets, nothing, and I had to go and have that cup of coffee.

I took it 2 more times since then and had some tea so I would expect to be wired, but nothing still.

This could be that my caffeine tolerance has built up over the week, so I may have to try again after a break from coffee. 

## Difficulty

First of all I found it really difficult to use the *tap-box*. I don't like getting my fingers in the snuff so I was looking forward to trying a tap-box, but I was really disappointed. It's hard to tap out a controlled portion. At first I started to tap lightly to get a little out and, nothing. So I tired stronger and stronger taps. Sometimes a big chunk would come out and some times little powder would go everywhere, and make a mess, especially on black clothes. Could be that I just don't know how to use a tap-box, so any tips would be appreciated.

The snuff it's self is really easy, so much that it's hard to know if you have really taken it. I had to keep looking to see if there was something still left. No burn and no drip just a nice cola smell.

There is no real difference from actually taking the snuff and just smelling it in the box, so I might just keep doing that to get the cola smell.

I have a tin of *Toque Coke* on the way from Mr.Snuff so I look forward to trying that.
